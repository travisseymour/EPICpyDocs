## EPICpy Documentation
Travis L. Seymour, PhD

EPIC is a computational cognitive architecture that specifies a theory of human performance and a facility to create individual task models constrained by that theory. EPIC compacts decades of psychological theory and findings into a rich set of processors and interactions, including those that model sensory perceptual, motor, cognitive, and memory subsystems of the human mind.

EPIC currently exists as an integration between a computational version of the architecture written in C++ (EPIClib) and a GUI-based simulation environment that uses it, also written in C++ (EPICapp). EPIC only runs on MacOS, and many tasks (e.g., writing virtual tasks, or perceptual encoders) requires knowledge of the C++ programming language.

**EPICpy** is a cross-platform Python-based interface to EPIClib (still in C++) that allows programming task devices and perceptual encoders in the Python programming language. However, EPIClib itself is still coded in C++.

`This repository contains the documentation for EPICpy, which can be found in its own repository (see below).`
